<p>You must read and accept the following agreement in order to use DogeWallet:</p>
<div class="well">
    <h3>1. GRANT OF LICENSE</h3>
    <p><b>1.1.</b> Subject to the terms and conditions contained within this end user agreement (the “Agreement“), dogeparty.net grants the “User” (or “you”) a non-exclusive, personal, non-transferable right to use the Services on your personal computer or other device that accesses the Internet, namely dogeparty.net, DogeWallet Mobile, DogeWallet Desktop, and Dogeparty federated nodes (together, the “Services“). By clicking the “I Agree“ button if and where provided and/or using the Service, you consent to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.</p>
    <p><b>1.2.</b> The Services are not for use by (i) individuals under 18 years of age, (ii) individuals under the legal age of majority in their jurisdiction and (iii) individuals accessing the Services from jurisdictions from which it is illegal to do so. Counterwallet.io and Counterwallet federated nodes are unable to verify the legality of the Services in each jurisdiction and it is the User\'s responsibility to ensure that their use of the Services is lawful. dogeparty.net, DogeWallet Mobile, and DogeWallet Desktop are neither banks nor regulated financial services. Operators do not have access to the Bitcoins stored on the platform, instead dogeparty.net, DogeWallet Mobile, and DogeWallet Desktop simply provide a means to access Bitcoins, Dogeparty (XDP), and other digital assets recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain. Bitcoin private keys are encrypted using the BIP32 Hierarchical Deterministic Wallet algorithm such that Dogeparty.net, DogeWallet Mobile, and DogeWallet Desktop cannot access or recover Bitcoins, Dogeparty (XDP), or other digital assets in the event of lost or stolen password. </p>
    <h3>2. NO WARRANTIES.</h3>

    <h3>7. AMENDMENT</h3>
    <p>DogeWallet and the Services reserve the right to update or modify this Agreement or any part thereof at any time or otherwise change the Services without notice and you will be bound by such amended Agreement upon publication.

Nothing in this clause shall limit the right of the Services to take proceedings against you in any other court of competent jurisdiction, nor shall the taking of proceedings in any one or more jurisdictions preclude the taking of proceedings in any other jurisdictions, whether concurrently or not, to the extent permitted by the law of such other jurisdiction.</p>
    <h3>9. SEVERABILITY</h3>
    <p>If a provision of this Agreement is or becomes illegal, invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, that shall not affect the validity or enforceability in that jurisdiction of any other provision hereof or the validity or enforceability in other jurisdictions of that or any other provision hereof.</p>

    <p>DogeWallet and the Services reserve the right to assign this agreement, in whole or in part, at any time without notice. The User may not assign any of his/her rights or obligations under this Agreement.</p>
    <h3>11. MISCELLANEOUS</h3>
    <p><b>11.1.</b> No waiver by DogeWallet nor by the Services of any breach of any provision of this Agreement (including the failure of DogeWallet and/or the Services to require strict and literal performance of or compliance with any provision of this Agreement) shall in any way be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach of such provision or of any breach of any other provision of this Agreement.</p>
    <p><b>11.2.</b> Nothing in this Agreement shall create or be deemed to create a partnership, agency, trust arrangement, fiduciary relationship or joint venture between you the User and DogeWallet, nor between you the User and the Services, to any extent.</p>
